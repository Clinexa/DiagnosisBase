## Supported Versions

Versions starting from 1.0 will be supported with security updates, but feel free
to report each version if you find a vulnerability.

| 0.x     | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a vulnerability via <<nikitaserba@icloud.com>>.

Clinexa isn't commercial yet and doesn't have enough budget, so we can't promise that
we will pay you a fee for a found vulnerability. But if we have enough money, we will.

Thank you for helping us!
